## About

This repo contains our final project for Code 201. The goal is to recreate Tetris in a webpage using what we've learned so far about HTML, CSS, and JS. We will use localStorage to track scores and any user settings. This should be a good representation of the culmination of all the skills we've learned in Code 201.

## Version 1.1

### The current version of the product does the following:

- contains separate pages for the game (home), the leaderboard, the how-to, and fun-facts
- creates tetris, complete with:
  - randomly generated pieces that fall
  - line-clearing logic
  - rotational logic
  - user input to move pieces
  - scoring
  - progressive difficulty increase
  - ability to pause/play
- records user scores and initials to local storage
- uses no external tools or libraries
