        <p>I grew up in southwest Connecticut with my parents and brother. I was always interested in technology and science, but never broke into the self-taught coder life in my youth. I commissioned in 2016 as an Infantry Officer in the US Army, also earning my Bachelors of Science in electrical engineering. I graduated the US Army Ranger School in 2017 and spent the following 5 years in various leadership roles that taught me a lot about leading teams of people, managing valuable resources, and budgeting time. I recently exited the military (2022) and am now following my dream of learning to create software by attending the Code Fellows Software Development bootcamp.</p>

        <p>Before I switched over to software development, I worked as a project manager and a researcher. The skills and tools I learned in project management and research are very transferable to software development, both of which require unique problem solving and a level of sociability. Software development is not necessarily a pivot away from those fields, rather it builds on top of them. Tech is prevalent in every aspect of our lives and it will continue to integrate itself into these professions to add functionality we didnâ€™t think was possible. I chose to transition into software development because I loved the creative problem solving aspect of it as there can be a multitude of solutions to the same problem and the social environment coding takes place in.</p>

        <p>Chris Hollis was raised in a military family and currently living in Scottsdale, AZ. He served 8 years in the U.S. Air Force as an F-15 Crew Chief and Combat Engineer. Since his military service he has worked in the medical field for 5 years and spent the last 6 years as a project engineer for Arizona Construction Services Group(AZCSG). He is now studying software engineering at Code Fellows.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Before I decided to change career paths I was working in the aerospace manufacturing industry. My main titles included CNC Machine Operator 2 and Hot Draper, but I was cross trained to learn many other roles including lay-up and tool-prep. I decided to learn Software Development, because I've always loved technology and I've always loved problem solving. Software Development feels like that perfect balance of those two.</p>
