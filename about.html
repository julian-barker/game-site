        <p>I'm a junior software developer with strong skills in web development. Prior to this, I was an Infantry Officer in the Army for 6 years, holding several managerial and leadership roles during that time. While I loved certain aspects of that profession, I recognized that the military is not the only way to serve, and I wanted to do something more cerebral. That desire led me to exit the service, but it was my proclivity for problem-solving, combined with my degree in Electrical Engineering, that led me to pursue software development. I'm now proficient in HTML, CSS, and Javascript and have a firm understanding of basic data structures and algorithms. In the longer term, I would love to learn about and work in the field of ML and AI, as I believe that AI will massively accelerate our progress in so many fields.</p>

        <p>Before I switched over to software development, I worked as a project manager and a researcher. The skills and tools I learned in project management and research are very transferable to software development, both of which require unique problem solving and a level of sociability. Software development is not necessarily a pivot away from those fields, rather it builds on top of them. Tech is prevalent in every aspect of our lives and it will continue to integrate itself into these professions to add functionality we didn’t think was possible. I chose to transition into software development because I loved the creative problem solving aspect of it as there can be a multitude of solutions to the same problem and the social environment coding takes place in.</p>

        </div>
        <p>I was born in The Netherlands and raised in a military family. Most my childhood was spent in Arizona, and currently living in Scottsdale, AZ. I served 8 years in the U.S. Air Force as an F-15 Crew Chief and Combat Engineer. Since my military service I worked in the medical field for 5 years as a medical assistant, phlebotomist and surgical technician and spent the last 6 years as a project manager with Arizona Construction Services Group(AZCSG). Body aches and daily DIS-EASE told me construction isn’t my life's path. With some inspiration from friends and family in the tech industry decided software engineering will allow me to exercise my mind, still work with a team, and build something great at the same time.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Before I decided to change career paths I was working in the aerospace manufacturing industry. My main titles included CNC Machine Operator 2 and Hot Draper, but I was cross trained to learn many other roles including lay-up and tool-prep. I decided to learn Software Development, because I've always loved technology and I've always loved problem solving. Software Development feels like that perfect balance of those two.</p>
